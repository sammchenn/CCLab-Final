                Obesius Porcinus Giganticus has been descended from Sus Scrofa Domesticus. Their history dates back to 10,000 years ago when pigs were first discovered. As pigs have evolved and been domesticated, Obesius Porcinus Giganticus no longer feels threatened by outside predators and their natural body has become slightly larger. They have not adjusted to humans being predators, however, so they are extremely friendly. While they can hunt for apples on their own, they especially love being hand fed apples.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Feel free to feed YIP YIP. YIP YIP is extremely friendly, but is oddly specific with the amount of apples she eats. She has to eat a certain amount of apples within 15 seconds to be full. However, that amount changes every day based upon how she feels. If you don't feed her the correct amount of apples within 15 seconds, she dies. If you overfeed her, she also dies. If you are able to correctly feed her the right amount of apples within 15 seconds apples, she will live and be super happy!
